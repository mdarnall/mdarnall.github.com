###My Reference Notes on CSS2 and CSS3

#####Box Model
There are two type of elements:  
1. Box elements: *Elements that by default fill the entire parent container*  
    <p> This is a classical block element </p>
    <div> This is also an example of a block element </div>
2. Inline elements: *Elements that are inline and don't disrupt the flow
   of other elements on that line*  
      <span>This is an example of an inline element</span>
