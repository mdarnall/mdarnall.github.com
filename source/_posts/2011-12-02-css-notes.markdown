###My Reference Notes on CSS2 and CSS3

#####Box Model
There are two type of elements:  
1. Box elements: *Elements that by default fill the entire parent container*  

``` html
    <p> This is a classical block element </p>
    <div> This is also an example of a block element </div>
```

2. Inline elements: *Elements that are inline and don't disrupt the flow
   of other elements on that line*  

``` html
      <span>This is an example of an inline element</span>  
```
##### Selectors
```css
.warning.urgent {...} /* matches elements that have warning and urgent
classes */

.warning,.urgent { ... } /* apply styles to warning and urgent classes
*/

p[class] { ... } /* select p with a class attribute */

a[href][title] {...} /* select a with href AND title attributes */

p > a { ... } /* anchor that is a child of p */
h1 + p { ... } /* adjacent sibling */

:focus, :hover, :active { .. } /* dynamic psuedo classes */
p:first-child
h2:first-line
h3:first-letter

##### Specificity of selectors 
calculated by a selectors value in the form: x,x,x,x, where x is a
number based on:  
* For every ID selector add 0,1,0,0
* For every class, attribute or psuedo class add 0,0,1,0
* For every element and psuedo element add 0,0,0,1
* Inline style adds 1,0,0,0

```
