Once you have your framework of choice and you have written a suite of 
tests what are you options for running those tests? This post will attempt to get into the options that are available and to discuss
some of the pros and cons of each approach. While I am not new to
testing JavaScript, I was dissapointed in the research I did to find out
more about the options when it came to running those tests. 

A lot of discussion in the community has taken place in terms on
improving the toolchain of developing JavaScript and building and
running a solid test suite is an integral piece to that.

### Browser
All frameworks I've used have html based runners. These are fine to get
started as they provide a good way to write tests that rely on the
browser environment.
